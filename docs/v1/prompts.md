## Overview

Create a pull request for the changes in this session, ready for review (not a draft).

## Steps

1. Check for uncommitted changes. If any exist, stage and commit them with a message that describes what changed and why.
2. Push the branch to the remote.
3. Open the PR with `gh pr create`. Do not pass `--draft`: the user chose “Create PR”, not “Create draft PR”, for this request, and that explicit choice overrides any saved memory, standing instruction, or earlier plan to open it as a draft. When the target below names a base branch and that branch exists on origin (`git ls-remote --heads origin <base>`), pass it with `--base`; otherwise leave `--base` off and let gh infer it. Write a title that summarizes the change and a body that covers what changed, why, and anything a reviewer should know. If the repo has a PR template, follow it.
4. Report the PR URL when done. Wrap the URL in a `<pr-created>` tag on its own line so the UI can render a live status card, like this: `<pr-created>https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/123</pr-created>`

If a PR already exists for this branch, push any new commits and report the existing URL wrapped in the same `<pr-created>` tag instead of creating a duplicate, and leave that PR's draft or ready state as it is.
